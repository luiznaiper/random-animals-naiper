# random-animals-naiper

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...
Just try out and see what animal you are most similar XD


## Install

```npm
npm install -g random-animal
```

# Usage

random-msg
```
